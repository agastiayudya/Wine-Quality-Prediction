### Project Background
The wine industry is characterized by a complex interplay of various factors that influence the quality of the final product. Winemakers often face the challenge of consistently producing wines of high quality, as the outcomes depend on factors such as grape variety, climate, soil conditions, and winemaking processes. To address this challenge, predictive modeling techniques can be employed to develop a system capable of forecasting wine quality based on key input variables.

### Objectives
The objective of this project is to design and implement a predictive model that can accurately predict the quality of wines based on relevant features.

### Additional Information
The quality rating of wine ranges from 0 to 10, where a score of 7 and above can be considered as good quality, while the rest are not.
